ProcDot analysis Below all the interactions done by the malware on the OS.

MarineGEO logo The dropped file, creates and sets a new bat file. MarineGEO logo In addition, the dropped exe file, tries to bypass all proxy settings on the infected machine. MarineGEO logo Another observed interesting behavior, is the creation of 5 executable files under the TEMP folder. MarineGEO logo The dropped speciem, infects all the executable files on the host. MarineGEO logo 2. Network traffic analysis Right after executing the malware, a DNS request for the domain 1.dnsnb8[.]net was observed. MarineGEO logo In wireshark, TCP connections towards the same domain on port 799 was observed. After reconfiguring the TCP simulation on Inetsim to accept incoming traffic on port 799, wireshark was able to catch HTTP requests to download .rar files.
